We act according to the accepted laws of the world. On the other hand, the people who are awakened to their powers seem to be able to ignore established laws, as if changing reality or perhaps even drawing from an entirely different one.\n\nHowever, if the awakened are subjected to drastic changes in their perceived reality, their basis for existence becomes threatened. Without a basis for existence, these people begin to fade from reality.\n\nDue to the dangers of this phenomena, I highly recommend more research is devoted to the study of this subject.",

Promising that my next experiment would not end in failure only seemed to make them angrier. Reasons unclear.\n\nDate: **/**. Weather Conditions: Overcast\nAnother one went haywire—and I even went and used a brand new reactor core this time! Thankfully Cipher's ice magic helped the golem cool down, so to speak. No major damage, though parts of the Academy are still rather... frosty. But, I have great news: this malfunction was NOT caused by the same thing as the last one. Splendid!

As a result, its existence is a topic of debate.\n\nA certain group of conservative-leaning teachers and bloodthirsty students are very adamant about not abolishing the rule—much to the dissatisfaction and concern of members of the Morality Preservation Committee.",
